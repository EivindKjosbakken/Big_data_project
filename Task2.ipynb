While RDD is just partitioned elements. Dataset is organized like DataFrame, but has some more functionality like better compile type safety. RDD and Dataset can work on both structured and unstructured data, while DataFrame require the data to be semi-structured or structured. Furthermore you can do different actions and transformations on each of them. Some operations can only be done on RDD, like the map() function. RDD has compile type safety, but lacks some optimization that the dataframe has (but df does not have compile type safety). Datasets have both, but at the same time it has limited with functions, so you might have to convert to dataframe when using them.\n\n\nWhen do you suggest using RDDs instead of using DataFrames?\n\nFirst of all, RDDs work on both structured and unstructured data, while dataframes requires the data to be atleast semistructured (since the data in organized in columns). So if you have data that is not structured, you should use a RDD. RDD should also be used if you want to do certain actions, and transformations on your data, since alot of actions and transformations can only be done on an RDD. For example the map function to manipulate every element in the RDD. Additionally RDD’s are resilient, so in case of losing a partition of the RDD, the complete RDD could be reconstructed. This is what makes the RDD fault-tolerant, so if a node fails in a computation, you can reconstruct the RDD, and then continue on with the computation, without having to restart.\n\n\nWhat is the main benefit of using DataSets instead of DataFrames?\n\nCompile-time type safety, the ability to alter data without knowing how the data is structured (the schema of the data). This is the reason DataSet was created in the first place (because of the limitation of compile-time type safety of dataframes, it also gave better optimization). If you for example do something wrong with a variable type, you will be informed when the script is compiled, and not when its ran (so you do not get a runtime error)"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"9c33ca21-1672-4c0c-a876-f73cbb8f65b2"}}}],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+notebook":{"notebookName":"Task2","dashboards":[],"notebookMetadata":{"pythonIndentUnit":2},"language":"python","widgets":{},"notebookOrigID":2457922486426844}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
